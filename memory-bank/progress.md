# Progress

## What Works
The core functionality of the application has been implemented:

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Email magic link authentication via Stytch
  - Context-aware handling of returning users
  - Automatic session checking and smart redirects
  
- **Form Submission**: 
  - 25-question form with progress tracking
  - Clear button labeling with "Get/Update Purpose" and "Get/Update Plan"
  
- **Database Schema**: Models for User, FormResponse, and Result with structured JSON data

- **AI Integration**: 
  - Basic plan generation after 5 questions
  - Premium plan generation after all 25 questions
  - Structured output using Pydantic models
  
- **Payment Processing**: 
  - Simplified two-tier payment model (Free Purpose tier, $4.99/month for Pursuit subscription)
  - Support for plan regeneration (free for subscription users)
  - Subscription management with cancel option
  
- **Results Display**: 
  - Enhanced visualization with structured sections
  - Intelligent parsing of AI-generated content
  - Visual timeline for Next Steps and card-based layouts
  - Content-specific icons based on keyword analysis
  - Mobile-responsive design with collapsible sections

## Latest Improvements
- **FIXED CRITICAL SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION BUG**: Resolved the issue where canceled subscriptions would lose access immediately instead of maintaining access until the end of the billing period:
  - Fixed subscription_management.py to always preserve subscription_end_date when canceling
  - Created has_premium_access() utility function in payment_utils.py to properly check premium access for all subscription states
  - Updated AI routes (ai_routes.py) and results endpoints (results.py) to use the new premium access logic
  - Added comprehensive test suite (test_subscription_fix.py) with 7 test cases covering all scenarios
  - Created background task module (app/tasks/subscription_cleanup.py) for subscription cleanup and expiration handling
  - Now canceled subscriptions properly maintain access until subscription_end_date expires
  - All tests passing: active subscriptions, canceled within period, expired subscriptions, legacy users, etc.

- Reworked plan offerings to simplify the payment model:
  - Made Purpose tier completely free (previously $0.99)
  - Removed Plan tier entirely (previously $4.99 one-time)
  - Kept Pursuit tier as the only paid option ($4.99/month subscription)
  - Updated backend code to handle free Purpose tier
  - Updated frontend to reflect new pricing structure
  - Updated unit tests to verify new behavior

- Improved subscription cancellation process:
  - Fixed backend to maintain Pursuit tier access until billing period ends
  - Added clear success message with dedicated modal showing exact end date
  - Updated all references from "Plan tier" to "Purpose tier" in cancellation flow
  - Added scheduled task note for handling expired subscriptions
  - Fixed account creation modal height issue by hiding redundant payment section

- Implemented subscription payment model with Pursuit tier at $4.99/month
- Created content marketing strategy with blog posts, guides, and FAQ content
- Fixed user flow issues with magic link and payment process
- Implemented new arrival flow for users to answer first five questions without account
- Added checkable items to Next Steps and Daily Plan sections
- Fixed broken authentication flow with multi-layered approach
- Improved mobile responsiveness with media queries and collapsible sections
- Enhanced subscription management UI with modern modal dialogs
- Fixed subscription workflow bugs:
  - Fixed direct update subscription status bug in payment_verification.py (using dictionary syntax for Stripe API responses)
  - Fixed duplicate subscription prevention in payment_checkout.py (added check for users with active subscriptions)
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for subscription workflows:
  - Added tests for subscription payment failures
  - Added tests for subscription status changes (past_due)
  - Added tests for direct update functionality
  - Added tests for regeneration payments
  - Added tests for duplicate subscription prevention
  - Added tests for subscription cancellation and tier downgrade

## What's Left to Build
- Update marketing language, home page, and FAQ to reflect new pricing structure
- Test all user flows to confirm the new behavior works correctly
- Create additional content for blog, guides, and FAQ sections
- Replace placeholder tracking IDs with actual analytics account IDs
- Fix the Pursuit tier account creation flow
- Improve subscription management error handling
- Continue improving mobile responsiveness
- Optimize AI prompts for better results
- Add export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Implement progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on simplifying the payment model to a freemium approach, implementing a subscription payment model, content marketing strategy, fixing authentication flow issues, and improving the mobile experience. The new payment model makes the Purpose tier completely free and keeps the Pursuit tier at $4.99/month with unlimited regenerations and checkbox tracking. These changes have significantly improved the user experience by simplifying the payment options, ensuring seamless authentication, and making the application more usable on mobile devices.

## Known Issues
- Plan and Pursuit tier account creation flow has issues with questions not appearing after tier selection

- Test suite improvements and remaining issues:
  - Model tests (User, FormResponse, Result) are now working correctly
  - Auth tests (login, session) are now passing
  - AI generation tests are now passing with updated error message assertions
  - Payment tests (checkout, verification, webhooks, subscription management) are now passing
  - SQLite in-memory database now uses "sqlite://" instead of "sqlite:///file::memory:?cache=shared" to prevent file residue
  - Fixed test_regenerate_results_endpoint by properly synchronizing test fixtures with the database session
  - Added comprehensive unit testing documentation in .clinerules
  - Integration tests have been updated to use the correct API endpoints (/api/users/ instead of /users/)
  - Integration tests are failing due to user registration issues (SQLite DateTime type error)
  - Integration tests still have issues with datetime serialization in JSON payloads
  - Some integration tests are failing due to endpoint path mismatches
  - Need to continue fixing the remaining integration tests

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Payment Model**: Evolved from two-tier system to three-tier model with subscription option, then simplified to a freemium model with free tier and subscription option
- **Authentication Flow**: Evolved from simple cookie-based auth to a robust multi-layered approach
- **Results Display**: Evolved from simple text to structured sections with intelligent parsing
- **Mobile Experience**: Enhanced with responsive design and collapsible sections
- **Content Strategy**: Added comprehensive marketing approach with blog, guides, and FAQ
- **Subscription Management**: Added modal dialogs, visual feedback, and resubscription options
- **Testing Approach**: Evolved to include proper database cleanup, comprehensive mocking of external services, and reusable testing patterns

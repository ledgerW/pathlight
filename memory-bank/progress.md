## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on implementing a subscription payment model, implementing a content marketing and SEO strategy, fixing the UI/UX issues with the Next Steps and Daily Plan sections, fixing the broken authentication flow with a comprehensive solution, fixing the redirection issue in the user authentication flow, improving the mobile experience with responsive design and collapsible sections, as well as fixing the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans and improving modal handling across the application. 

The subscription implementation adds a new "Pursuit" tier at $4.99/month with unlimited regenerations, checkbox tracking, and access to future premium features. It includes database schema updates, subscription management endpoints, and UI updates to show subscription options and status. The content marketing and SEO implementation includes templates for blog posts, guides, and FAQ content, with analytics tracking integration, schema.org markup for rich search results, and a file-based approach for easy content management. The checkbox UI/UX fixes implement consistent IDs for timeframe cards to ensure checkbox states persist between sessions, prioritize category-based icon selection over timeframe icons, and provide fallback to 'anonymous' user for cookie storage when userId is missing. The authentication flow fix implements a multi-layered approach using localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies to ensure users remain logged in across all scenarios, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. The redirection fix ensures existing users are properly redirected to the login page instead of an invalid URL. 

These changes have significantly improved the user experience by offering more flexible payment options, ensuring seamless authentication, making the application more usable on mobile devices, ensuring consistency between different parts of the application, fixing issues with loading spinners and checkbox functionality, and providing valuable content to help users understand the purpose discovery process.

## Known Issues
- Subscription management has a few remaining issues:
  - The subscribe button for Plan tier users and the resubscribe button for users with canceled subscriptions aren't properly updating the user's status in the database table
  - The verification process for subscription payments needs to be improved to ensure database fields are consistently updated

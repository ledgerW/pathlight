# Progress

## What Works
The core functionality of the application has been implemented:

- **User Authentication**: Email magic link authentication via Stytch
- **Form Submission**: 25-question form with progress tracking
- **Database Schema**: Models for User, FormResponse, and Result
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Basic plan generation after 5 questions
  - Premium plan generation after all 25 questions
  - Structured output using Pydantic models
- **Payment Processing**: Two-tier payment model ($0.99 for basic, $4.99 for premium)
- **Results Display**: Visualization of both basic and premium results

Recent database migrations have improved the structure:
- Replaced text-based summary with structured JSON basic_plan
- Added last_generated_at column to track result generation time

## What's Left to Build
- Result regeneration functionality
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on improving the database schema and enhancing the AI result generation. The memory bank has been updated to reflect these changes.

## Known Issues
- Database migrations need to handle both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Database Schema**: Evolved from simple text storage to structured JSON for results
- **AI Integration**: Enhanced with structured output using Pydantic models
- **Result Tracking**: Added last_generated_at to track when results were generated
- **Payment Model**: Implemented two-tier system with specific price points

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

# Progress

## What Works
The core functionality of the application has been implemented:

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Email magic link authentication via Stytch
  - Improved flow for existing users with saved responses
  - Context-aware handling of returning users
- **Form Submission**: 
  - 25-question form with progress tracking
  - Improved navigation at question 5 for users with basic results
  - Clear button labeling with "Get Purpose"/"Update Purpose" and "Get Plan"/"Update Plan"
- **Database Schema**: Models for User, FormResponse, and Result
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Basic plan generation after 5 questions
  - Premium plan generation after all 25 questions
  - Structured output using Pydantic models
- **Payment Processing**: Two-tier payment model ($0.99 for basic, $4.99 for premium)
- **Results Display**: 
  - Enhanced visualization of both basic and premium results
  - Structured display of plan sections with visual elements
  - Intelligent parsing of AI-generated content

Recent database migrations have improved the structure:
- Replaced text-based summary with structured JSON basic_plan
- Added last_generated_at column to track result generation time
- Added regeneration_count column to track how many times results have been regenerated

Recent authentication improvements:
- Enhanced find_user_by_email endpoint to check for existing responses and results
- Updated client-side code to send magic links to users with existing data
- Improved user experience for returning users

Recent UI improvements:
- Enhanced results display with structured, visually appealing sections
- Implemented visual timeline for Next Steps with 7, 30, and 180-day sections
- Created card-based layout for Daily Plan with morning, afternoon, and evening sections
- Designed paired cards for Obstacles & Solutions
- Improved handling of basic vs premium results to prioritize premium content

## What's Left to Build
- Testing of the updated form navigation in all scenarios
- Testing of the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Testing of the enhanced results display with various AI-generated content formats
- Additional error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results
- Export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on improving the database schema, enhancing the AI result generation, refining the user authentication flow, improving the form navigation experience, implementing result regeneration functionality with payment support, and significantly enhancing the results display with structured, visually appealing sections. The memory bank has been updated to reflect these changes.

## Known Issues
- Database migrations should only use PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion
- AI content parsing may need refinement for edge cases where content doesn't follow expected patterns

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Database Schema**: Evolved from simple text storage to structured JSON for results
- **AI Integration**: Enhanced with structured output using Pydantic models
- **Result Tracking**: Added last_generated_at and regeneration_count to track result generation history
- **Payment Model**: Implemented two-tier system with specific price points and support for regeneration payments
- **Authentication Flow**: Evolved to be context-aware, checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach
- **Form Navigation**: Improved to provide clear options for users with existing results
- **Database Migrations**: Standardized on using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL for all migrations
- **Results Display**: Evolved from simple text display to structured, visually appealing sections with intelligent content parsing

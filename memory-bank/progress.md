- Testing of the updated form navigation in all scenarios
- Testing of the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Additional error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results

- Progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on implementing a content marketing and SEO strategy, fixing the UI/UX issues with the Next Steps and Daily Plan sections, fixing the broken authentication flow with a comprehensive solution, fixing the redirection issue in the user authentication flow, improving the mobile experience with responsive design and collapsible sections, as well as fixing the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans and improving modal handling across the application. 

The content marketing and SEO implementation includes templates for blog posts, guides, and FAQ content, with analytics tracking integration, schema.org markup for rich search results, and a file-based approach for easy content management. The checkbox UI/UX fixes implement consistent IDs for timeframe cards to ensure checkbox states persist between sessions, prioritize category-based icon selection over timeframe icons, and provide fallback to 'anonymous' user for cookie storage when userId is missing. The authentication flow fix implements a multi-layered approach using localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies to ensure users remain logged in across all scenarios, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. The redirection fix ensures existing users are properly redirected to the login page instead of an invalid URL. 

These changes have significantly improved the user experience by ensuring seamless authentication, making the application more usable on mobile devices, ensuring consistency between different parts of the application, fixing issues with loading spinners and checkbox functionality, and providing valuable content to help users understand the purpose discovery process.

## Known Issues
- ~~New user arrival flow has several unresolved issues~~ (Fixed):
  - ~~Anonymous responses are not being properly transferred to new user accounts~~ (Fixed by saving responses individually)
  - ~~Authentication is not working correctly after account creation~~ (Fixed with proper token handling)
  - ~~Magic link emails are not being sent consistently~~ (Fixed with improved email sending)
  - ~~Results are not being generated after payment~~ (Fixed with proper flow implementation)
  - ~~The implementation requires significant debugging and rework~~ (Completed)
  - ~~Users are being redirected to login page after payment instead of seeing email instructions~~ (Fixed with dedicated payment success page)
- Database migrations should only use PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion
- AI content parsing may need refinement for edge cases where content doesn't follow expected patterns
- Mobile responsiveness improvements are currently limited to the results page
- Collapsible sections might need additional testing on older mobile browsers
- Some UI elements may need further size adjustments for very small screens

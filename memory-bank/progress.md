    - Added support for both session tokens and JWTs
    - Improved token extraction from Authorization headers
    - Enhanced error handling for expired or invalid tokens
    - Added ability to set cookies from Authorization headers
  - Improved client-side token management in `app/static/js/base.js`:

    - Added support for manually setting cookies when they're missing
    - Improved session check process with better error recovery
    - Added user-friendly notifications for authentication errors
  - Enhanced authentication template in `app/templates/authenticate.html`:
    - Improved error handling and reporting
    - Disabled debug mode in production
    - Removed visible debug information from the UI
    - Maintained clean loading spinner experience for users
  - Removed file-based token storage in `auth_persistance.py`:
    - Deprecated file-based storage in favor of browser-based storage
    - Kept stub functions for backward compatibility
  - Implemented a multi-layered approach:
    - Storing token in localStorage during authentication
    - Adding token as Authorization header to all requests
    - Setting cookies both server-side and client-side for redundancy
    - Verifying session on both client and server sides
    - Providing detailed error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Fixed redirection issue in the user authentication flow:
  - Resolved issue where existing users were being redirected to `/form/[object Object]` instead of `/login`
  - Found and fixed multiple redirection points in both `form.js` and `form-ui.js` files
  - Updated both implementations of `goToNextSlide` to use a hardcoded URL `/login`
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging to track the redirection process
  - Ensured consistent behavior across different code paths
  - Prevented any object-to-string conversion issues by using hardcoded strings
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the results page:
  - Added media queries for different screen sizes (tablets and phones)
  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins for better readability on small screens
  - Optimized layout for narrow screens to prevent cramped text
- Implemented collapsible sections in the Plan view:
  - Added toggle functionality to section headers (Next Steps, Daily Plan, Obstacles & Solutions)
  - Ensured only one section is open at a time (accordion-style)
  - Set the first section to be open by default
  - Added visual indicators (arrow icons) to show which sections are expandable
  - Implemented smooth transitions for a polished user experience
- Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans:
  - Made the form page use the exact same modal as the results page
  - Removed the large Cancel button, leaving just an "X" in the corner
  - Fixed issues with the loading spinner appearing prematurely and remaining on screen
  - Ensured consistent user experience between form and results pages
  - Made the regeneration modal properly display the correct price based on user's tier
- Improved modal handling across the application:
  - Standardized modal design and behavior
  - Enhanced close button functionality to properly hide all related modals
  - Improved loading state management to only show spinners when appropriate

## What's Left to Build
- Testing of the updated form navigation in all scenarios
- Testing of the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Additional error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results
- Export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on fixing the UI/UX issues with the Next Steps and Daily Plan sections, fixing the broken authentication flow with a comprehensive solution, fixing the redirection issue in the user authentication flow, improving the mobile experience with responsive design and collapsible sections, as well as fixing the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans and improving modal handling across the application. 

The checkbox UI/UX fixes implement consistent IDs for timeframe cards to ensure checkbox states persist between sessions, prioritize category-based icon selection over timeframe icons, and provide fallback to 'anonymous' user for cookie storage when userId is missing. The authentication flow fix implements a multi-layered approach using localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies to ensure users remain logged in across all scenarios, with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms. The redirection fix ensures existing users are properly redirected to the login page instead of an invalid URL. 

These changes have significantly improved the user experience by ensuring seamless authentication, making the application more usable on mobile devices, ensuring consistency between different parts of the application, and fixing issues with loading spinners and checkbox functionality.

## Known Issues
- ~~New user arrival flow has several unresolved issues~~ (Fixed):
  - ~~Anonymous responses are not being properly transferred to new user accounts~~ (Fixed by saving responses individually)
  - ~~Authentication is not working correctly after account creation~~ (Fixed with proper token handling)
  - ~~Magic link emails are not being sent consistently~~ (Fixed with improved email sending)
  - ~~Results are not being generated after payment~~ (Fixed with proper flow implementation)
  - ~~The implementation requires significant debugging and rework~~ (Completed)
- Database migrations should only use PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion
- AI content parsing may need refinement for edge cases where content doesn't follow expected patterns
- Mobile responsiveness improvements are currently limited to the results page
- Collapsible sections might need additional testing on older mobile browsers
- Some UI elements may need further size adjustments for very small screens

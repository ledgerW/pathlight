# Progress

## What Works
The core functionality of the application has been implemented:

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Email magic link authentication via Stytch
  - Context-aware handling of returning users
  - Automatic session checking and smart redirects
- **Form Submission**: 
  - 25-question form with progress tracking
  - Clear button labeling with "Get/Update Purpose" and "Get/Update Plan"
- **Database Schema**: Models for User, FormResponse, and Result with structured JSON data
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Basic plan generation after 5 questions
  - Premium plan generation after all 25 questions
  - Structured output using Pydantic models
- **Payment Processing**: 
  - Two-tier payment model ($0.99 for basic, $4.99 for premium)
  - Support for plan regeneration payments
  - Tracking of regeneration count and timestamps
- **Results Display**: 
  - Enhanced visualization with structured sections
  - Intelligent parsing of AI-generated content
  - Visual timeline for Next Steps and card-based layouts
  - Content-specific icons based on keyword analysis
  - "Update Plan" button with confirmation modal
  - Mobile-responsive design with optimized typography and spacing
  - Collapsible sections for better mobile experience

## Latest Improvements
- Fixed authentication flow issues with magic links in production:
  - Added proper security attributes to cookies in production environments
  - Set `secure=True` for HTTPS environments
  - Added `samesite="lax"` to allow cookies to be sent with same-site navigations
  - Ensured consistent cookie settings throughout the authentication flow
  - Added detailed logging to track cookie operations
  - Updated logout function to use matching settings when clearing cookies
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the results page:
  - Added media queries for different screen sizes (tablets and phones)
  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins for better readability on small screens
  - Optimized layout for narrow screens to prevent cramped text
- Implemented collapsible sections in the Plan view:
  - Added toggle functionality to section headers (Next Steps, Daily Plan, Obstacles & Solutions)
  - Ensured only one section is open at a time (accordion-style)
  - Set the first section to be open by default
  - Added visual indicators (arrow icons) to show which sections are expandable
  - Implemented smooth transitions for a polished user experience
- Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans:
  - Made the form page use the exact same modal as the results page
  - Removed the large Cancel button, leaving just an "X" in the corner
  - Fixed issues with the loading spinner appearing prematurely and remaining on screen
  - Ensured consistent user experience between form and results pages
  - Made the regeneration modal properly display the correct price based on user's tier
- Improved modal handling across the application:
  - Standardized modal design and behavior
  - Enhanced close button functionality to properly hide all related modals
  - Improved loading state management to only show spinners when appropriate

## What's Left to Build
- Testing of the updated form navigation in all scenarios
- Testing of the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Additional error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results
- Export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on fixing authentication flow issues with magic links in production environments, improving the mobile experience with responsive design and collapsible sections, as well as fixing the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans and improving modal handling across the application. The authentication flow fix ensures that users remain logged in after following magic links, particularly in production HTTPS environments where browser cookie policies are stricter. These changes have significantly improved the user experience by ensuring seamless authentication, making the application more usable on mobile devices, ensuring consistency between different parts of the application, and fixing issues with loading spinners.

## Known Issues
- Database migrations should only use PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion
- AI content parsing may need refinement for edge cases where content doesn't follow expected patterns
- Mobile responsiveness improvements are currently limited to the results page
- Collapsible sections might need additional testing on older mobile browsers
- Some UI elements may need further size adjustments for very small screens
- Authentication cookie settings may need further refinement for specific browser versions or unusual network configurations

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Database Schema**: Evolved from simple text storage to structured JSON for results
- **AI Integration**: Enhanced with structured output using Pydantic models
- **Payment Model**: Implemented two-tier system with support for regeneration payments
- **Authentication Flow**: Evolved to be context-aware with automatic session checking and enhanced cookie security for production environments
- **Form Navigation**: Improved to provide clear options for users with existing results
- **Results Display**: Evolved from simple text to structured sections with intelligent parsing
- **Content Presentation**: Evolved to bullet lists with content-specific icons
- **User Experience**: Enhanced with consistent UI patterns and smart redirects
- **Modal Design**: Standardized across the application for consistency
- **Loading States**: Refined to only show spinners when actually loading content
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Evolved from desktop-focused to fully responsive with mobile-specific optimizations
- **Content Organization**: Evolved to use collapsible sections for better space utilization and focus
- **Interactive Elements**: Enhanced with visual indicators and smooth transitions

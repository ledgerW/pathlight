# Progress

## What Works
As this is the initial documentation phase, we're establishing a baseline understanding of the project. The memory bank structure has been created with the following files:
- `projectbrief.md`: Overview of the project goals and requirements
- `productContext.md`: User journey and business model
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Technology stack and file organization
- `activeContext.md`: Current focus and next steps

## What's Left to Build
- Deeper understanding of specific functionality
- Documentation of database schema
- Analysis of AI integration
- Documentation of form submission flow
- Analysis of results display
- Understanding of payment processing
- Identification of any bugs or issues

## Current Status
The memory bank initialization is complete. The next phase will involve exploring specific files to gain a deeper understanding of the application's functionality.

## Known Issues
No specific issues have been identified yet, as this is the initial documentation phase.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
As this is the initial documentation phase, we haven't yet tracked the evolution of project decisions. This section will be updated as we gain more insights into the project's history and development.

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

# Progress

## What Works
The core functionality of the application has been implemented:

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Email magic link authentication via Stytch
  - Improved flow for existing users with saved responses
  - Context-aware handling of returning users
  - Automatic session checking on site arrival
  - Smart redirects based on user's progress and results
- **Form Submission**: 
  - 25-question form with progress tracking
  - Improved navigation at question 5 for users with basic results
  - Clear button labeling with "Get Purpose"/"Update Purpose" and "Get Plan"/"Update Plan"
- **Database Schema**: Models for User, FormResponse, and Result
- **AI Integration**: 
  - Basic plan generation after 5 questions
  - Premium plan generation after all 25 questions
  - Structured output using Pydantic models
- **Payment Processing**: 
  - Two-tier payment model ($0.99 for basic, $4.99 for premium)
  - Support for plan regeneration payments
  - Tracking of regeneration count and timestamps
- **Results Display**: 
  - Enhanced visualization of both basic and premium results
  - Structured display of plan sections with visual elements
  - Intelligent parsing of AI-generated content
  - "Update Plan" button for premium users to regenerate their plan

Recent database migrations have improved the structure:
- Replaced text-based summary with structured JSON basic_plan
- Added last_generated_at column to track result generation time
- Added regeneration_count column to track how many times results have been regenerated

Recent authentication improvements:
- Enhanced find_user_by_email endpoint to check for existing responses and results
- Updated client-side code to send magic links to users with existing data
- Improved user experience for returning users
- Added automatic session checking on site arrival
- Enhanced home page and login routes to check for valid sessions
- Fixed 422 validation error in the find_user_by_email endpoint with proper email validation
- Added support for both query parameter and request body methods in user lookup
- Implemented token extraction from expired sessions to maintain user context
- Improved error handling with more specific error messages
- Enhanced session handling for a smoother return experience

Recent UI improvements:
- Enhanced results display with structured, visually appealing sections
- Implemented visual timeline for Next Steps with Today, 7, 30, and 180-day sections
- Created card-based layout for Daily Plan with morning, afternoon, and evening sections
- Designed paired cards for Obstacles & Solutions
- Improved handling of basic vs premium results to prioritize premium content
- Added content-specific icons for daily plan items and next steps based on keyword analysis
- Restructured daily plan items and next steps as bullet lists for better readability
- Implemented a smart icon selection system with 20 topic-specific icons (learning, fitness, work, etc.)
- Fixed issue with Today actions displaying twice in the timeline
- Added "Update Plan" button for premium users
- Created confirmation modal for plan regeneration with clear pricing information

## What's Left to Build
- Testing of the updated form navigation in all scenarios
- Testing of the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Testing of the enhanced results display with various AI-generated content formats
- Testing of the new content-specific icon system with various types of plan items
- Testing of the automatic session checking and redirection flow
- Additional error handling for edge cases
- Improved user experience for the payment flow
- Additional analytics and tracking
- Admin dashboard for monitoring
- Optimization of AI prompts for better results
- Export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Progress tracking for completed plan items

## Current Status
The application is functional with the core features implemented. Recent work has focused on improving the database schema, enhancing the AI result generation, refining the user authentication flow, improving the form navigation experience, implementing result regeneration functionality with payment support, and significantly enhancing the results display with structured, visually appealing sections. 

The latest improvements include:
- Adding an "Update Plan" button with confirmation modal for premium users to regenerate their plan
- Implementing automatic session checking on site arrival to provide a seamless experience for returning users
- Fixing the 422 validation error in the find_user_by_email endpoint with proper email validation
- Enhancing user data loading to ensure existing account info is properly displayed
- Improving session handling to ensure a smooth return for returning users
- Updating web routes to ensure users are always redirected to their form even when they have no progress
- Adding loading indicators during user authentication and account checking
- Improving welcome messages for returning users to provide a more personalized experience

These changes have significantly improved the user arrival flow, making it smoother for returning users and fixing several bugs that were causing issues with the authentication process. The memory bank has been updated to reflect these changes.

## Known Issues
- Database migrations should only use PostgreSQL (not SQLite)
- Error handling for AI generation could be improved
- The payment flow UX could be enhanced for better conversion
- AI content parsing may need refinement for edge cases where content doesn't follow expected patterns

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Database Schema**: Evolved from simple text storage to structured JSON for results
- **AI Integration**: Enhanced with structured output using Pydantic models
- **Result Tracking**: Added last_generated_at and regeneration_count to track result generation history
- **Payment Model**: Implemented two-tier system with specific price points and support for regeneration payments
- **Authentication Flow**: Evolved to be context-aware, checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach
- **Form Navigation**: Improved to provide clear options for users with existing results
- **Database Migrations**: Standardized on using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL for all migrations
- **Results Display**: Evolved from simple text display to structured, visually appealing sections with intelligent content parsing
- **Content Presentation**: Evolved from paragraph text to bullet lists with content-specific icons for better readability
- **Visual Cues**: Added smart icon selection system that analyzes content and assigns appropriate icons from a set of topic-specific icons
- **User Experience**: Enhanced with automatic session checking and smart redirects to reduce friction
- **Plan Management**: Added ability for users to regenerate their plan with a clear confirmation process

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

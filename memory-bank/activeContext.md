    - Setting cookies both server-side and client-side for redundancy
    - Verifying session on both client and server sides
    - Providing detailed error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Fixed redirection issue in the user authentication flow:
  - Resolved issue where existing users were being redirected to `/form/[object Object]` instead of `/login`
  - Found and fixed multiple redirection points in both `form.js` and `form-ui.js` files
  - Updated both implementations of `goToNextSlide` to use a hardcoded URL `/login`
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging to track the redirection process
  - Ensured consistent behavior across different code paths
  - Prevented any object-to-string conversion issues by using hardcoded strings
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the results page:
  - Added media queries for different screen sizes (tablets and phones)
  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins for better readability on small screens
  - Optimized layout for narrow screens to prevent cramped text
- Implemented collapsible sections in the Plan view:
  - Added toggle functionality to section headers (Next Steps, Daily Plan, Obstacles & Solutions)
  - Ensured only one section is open at a time (accordion-style)
  - Set the first section to be open by default
  - Added visual indicators (arrow icons) to show which sections are expandable
  - Implemented smooth transitions for a polished user experience
- Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans:
  - Made the form page use the exact same modal as the results page
  - Removed the large Cancel button, leaving just an "X" in the corner
  - Fixed issues with the loading spinner appearing prematurely and remaining on screen
  - Ensured consistent user experience between form and results pages
  - Made the regeneration modal properly display the correct price based on user's tier
- Improved modal handling across the application:
  - Standardized modal design and behavior
  - Enhanced close button functionality to properly hide all related modals
  - Improved loading state management to only show spinners when appropriate

## Next Steps
- Continue improving mobile responsiveness across the entire application
- Consider adding tablet-specific optimizations for mid-size screens
- Refine the user experience for the payment flow
- Implement additional error handling and edge cases
- Optimize AI prompt templates for better insights
- Consider adding export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Explore adding progress tracking for completed plan items

## Learnings and Insights
- The application is an AI-powered life purpose guidance system
- The two-tier payment model allows users to get basic insights before committing to the full experience
- Astrological signs provide personalization without being explicitly mentioned to users
- Stoic philosophy underpins the guidance provided
- Database schema evolution requires careful migration planning
- User authentication flow needs to be context-aware to provide a seamless experience
- Modern browsers have increasingly strict cookie policies in HTTPS environments, requiring proper security attributes
- Production environments require secure=True and appropriate samesite attributes for cookies to work properly
- A multi-layered authentication approach (localStorage + Authorization headers + cookies) provides the most robust solution
- Browser security policies can block cookies in certain scenarios, requiring fallback mechanisms
- Client-side token storage in localStorage with Authorization headers provides a reliable fallback when cookies fail
- Detailed logging and error handling are essential for troubleshooting authentication issues
- Checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach improves user experience
- The project uses PostgreSQL for the database, not SQLite
- Database migrations should be written using SQLAlchemy and the project's existing migration patterns
- Always use Poetry to run Python scripts in this project (e.g., `poetry run python script.py`)
- Payment systems need to be flexible to allow for scenarios like result regeneration
- AI-generated content needs intelligent parsing to create structured, user-friendly displays
- Visual organization of information significantly improves user experience and comprehension
- Content-specific icons provide immediate visual cues that help users quickly understand the nature of each item
- Bullet list format makes structured content more scannable and digestible for users
- Keyword analysis can be used to intelligently assign relevant icons to content items
- Automatic session checking improves user experience by reducing unnecessary login steps
- Confirmation modals for paid actions help users make informed decisions
- Consistent UI patterns between different parts of the application improve user experience
- Loading spinners should only be shown when actually loading content, not during confirmation steps
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for modern web applications, requiring specific optimizations
- Collapsible sections significantly improve mobile experience by reducing scrolling and focusing attention
- Accordion-style UI patterns are effective for presenting multiple content sections in limited space
- Visual indicators (like arrows) help users understand interactive elements

# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing and refining the database schema, AI integration, and user authentication flow for the life purpose application. The focus is on supporting the three-tier payment model (including subscription option), improving result generation, enhancing the user experience, and streamlining the authentication process.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented subscription payment model:
  - Added subscription tier ("Pursuit") at $4.99/month
  - Updated database schema to support subscriptions
  - Modified payment flow to handle subscriptions
  - Added subscription management endpoints
  - Implemented free regeneration for subscription users
  - Renamed tiers from basic/premium to purpose/plan/pursuit for clarity

- Implemented content marketing and SEO strategy:
  - Created templates for blog posts, guides, and FAQ content
  - Integrated analytics tracking
  - Updated sitemap.xml to include new content pages
  - Structured content templates with SEO best practices built-in

- Fixed user flow issues with magic link and payment process:
  - Modified the flow to show email notification only after payment is complete
  - Created a dedicated payment success page for users with magic links
  - Implemented background results generation that doesn't trigger redirects
  - Enhanced payment verification to properly handle magic link users

- Fixed broken authentication flow with comprehensive solution:
  - Enhanced server-side authentication with support for both session tokens and JWTs
  - Improved client-side token management with robust error handling
  - Implemented a multi-layered approach with localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies

- Improved mobile responsiveness and UI/UX:
  - Added media queries for different screen sizes
  - Implemented collapsible sections in the Plan view
  - Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality
  - Standardized modal design and behavior across the application

- Fixed subscription management UI and database issues:
  - Replaced browser alert boxes with modern modal dialogs
  - Added null checks for subscription_end_date
  - Improved the webhook handler for subscription management
  - Added "Resubscribe" button for users who previously canceled

## Next Steps
- Create additional content for blog, guides, and FAQ sections
- Replace placeholder tracking IDs with actual analytics account IDs
- Monitor SEO performance and make adjustments as needed

- Continue improving the test suite:
  - Fix remaining integration tests (purpose_tier_journey, plan_tier_journey, pursuit_tier_journey)
  - Fix the user registration issue in integration tests (SQLite DateTime type error)
  - Fix endpoint path mismatches in integration tests
  - Resolve datetime serialization issues in JSON payloads for integration tests
  - Add more comprehensive test coverage for all components

- Fix the Plan and Pursuit tier account creation flow:
  - Debug and fix the issue with questions not appearing after selecting Plan or Pursuit tier
  - Fix the account creation process to properly handle the subscription flow
  - Ensure proper authentication after account creation

- Improve subscription management:
  - Fix the remaining issues with the subscribe and resubscribe buttons
  - Add more comprehensive error handling for subscription-related operations

- Continue improving mobile responsiveness across the entire application
- Refine the user experience for the payment flow
- Optimize AI prompt templates for better insights
- Consider adding export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)

## Active Decisions
- Using a file-based approach for content management rather than a database-driven CMS
- Using a consistent template structure for all content types
- Following SEO best practices for all content pages

- Using structured JSON data for storing AI-generated results
- Implementing a three-tier payment model (purpose: $0.99, plan: $4.99, pursuit: $4.99/month subscription)
- Using a multi-layered authentication approach with localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies
- Using environment-specific cookie settings for authentication
- Using intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI-generated text
- Using content-specific icons for bullet points to improve visual comprehension

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular code organization (separate files for different concerns)
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Component-based JavaScript structure
- Database migrations for schema evolution using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
- Structured AI output with defined schemas
- Multi-layered authentication with localStorage, Authorization headers, and cookies
- Visual design patterns with cards, timelines, and color-coded sections
- Intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI text
- Content-specific icons for bullet points based on keyword analysis
- Modal confirmation dialogs for important user actions
- Responsive design with breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 480px (mobile)
- Collapsible sections with accordion behavior for better space utilization
- Template-based content structure with clear variable definitions
- SEO-optimized meta tags and schema.org markup for all content
- Comprehensive testing approach with proper database cleanup and external service mocking

## Learnings and Insights
- The application is an AI-powered life purpose guidance system
- The three-tier payment model allows users to get basic insights before committing to the full experience
- Modern browsers have increasingly strict cookie policies in HTTPS environments
- A multi-layered authentication approach provides the most robust solution
- Browser security policies can block cookies in certain scenarios, requiring fallback mechanisms
- The project uses PostgreSQL for the database, not SQLite
- Always use Poetry to run Python scripts in this project (e.g., `poetry run python script.py`)
- AI-generated content needs intelligent parsing to create structured, user-friendly displays
- Visual organization of information significantly improves user experience and comprehension
- Collapsible sections significantly improve mobile experience by reducing scrolling
- Content marketing and SEO are essential for building awareness and educating users
- Subscription management requires careful handling of database fields and user interface elements
- NULL values in database fields need to be handled gracefully in templates to prevent errors
- In-memory SQLite databases for testing should use "sqlite://" instead of "sqlite:///file::memory:?cache=shared" to prevent file residue
- Test assertions must be updated when error messages change in the application code
- Test fixtures may need manual synchronization with the database session used by endpoints

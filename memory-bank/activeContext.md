# Active Context

## Current Focus
The memory bank is being initialized to document the existing project structure and functionality. This is the first step in establishing a comprehensive understanding of the application.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank directory and initial documentation files
- Documented project overview, architecture, and technical context

## Next Steps
- Explore key files to better understand specific functionality
- Document the database schema and relationships
- Investigate AI integration details
- Understand the form submission and results display flow
- Examine the payment processing implementation

## Active Decisions
- Organizing documentation in a structured memory bank
- Using markdown format for all documentation files
- Inferring system architecture and patterns from file structure

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular code organization (separate files for different concerns)
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Component-based JavaScript structure
- Database migrations for schema evolution

## Learnings and Insights
- The application appears to be an AI-powered form processing system
- User authentication and payment processing suggest a freemium model
- The modular structure indicates a focus on maintainability and scalability
- Database migrations suggest an evolving data model

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

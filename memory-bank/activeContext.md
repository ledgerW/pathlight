# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing and refining the database schema, AI integration, and user authentication flow for the life purpose application. The focus is on supporting the two-tier payment model, improving result generation, enhancing the user experience, and streamlining the authentication process.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed authentication flow issues with magic links in production:
  - Added proper security attributes to cookies in production environments
  - Set `secure=True` for HTTPS environments
  - Added `samesite="lax"` to allow cookies to be sent with same-site navigations
  - Ensured consistent cookie settings throughout the authentication flow
  - Added detailed logging to track cookie operations
  - Updated logout function to use matching settings when clearing cookies
- Improved mobile responsiveness for the results page:
  - Added media queries for different screen sizes (tablets and phones)
  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins for better readability on small screens
  - Optimized layout for narrow screens to prevent cramped text
- Implemented collapsible sections in the Plan view:
  - Added toggle functionality to section headers (Next Steps, Daily Plan, Obstacles & Solutions)
  - Ensured only one section is open at a time (accordion-style)
  - Set the first section to be open by default
  - Added visual indicators (arrow icons) to show which sections are expandable
  - Implemented smooth transitions for a polished user experience
- Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans:
  - Made the form page use the exact same modal as the results page
  - Removed the large Cancel button, leaving just an "X" in the corner
  - Fixed issues with the loading spinner appearing prematurely and remaining on screen
  - Ensured consistent user experience between form and results pages
  - Made the regeneration modal properly display the correct price based on user's tier
- Improved modal handling across the application:
  - Standardized modal design and behavior
  - Enhanced close button functionality to properly hide all related modals
  - Improved loading state management to only show spinners when appropriate

## Next Steps
- Continue improving mobile responsiveness across the entire application
- Consider adding tablet-specific optimizations for mid-size screens
- Refine the user experience for the payment flow
- Implement additional error handling and edge cases
- Optimize AI prompt templates for better insights
- Consider adding export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Explore adding progress tracking for completed plan items

## Active Decisions
- Using structured JSON data for storing AI-generated results
- Implementing a two-tier payment model (basic: $0.99, premium: $4.99)
- Using database migrations for schema evolution
- Incorporating astrological signs and Stoic philosophy in AI guidance
- Using Pydantic models for structured AI output
- Sending magic links to users with existing data to ensure secure access
- Using environment-specific cookie settings for authentication (secure=True and samesite="lax" in production)
- Using intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI-generated text
- Implementing visually distinct sections for different parts of the life plan
- Using content-specific icons for bullet points to improve visual comprehension
- Structuring daily plan and next steps as bullet lists for better readability
- Providing plan regeneration option for premium users
- Implementing automatic session checking for seamless user experience
- Using consistent modal design patterns across the application
- Using responsive design with media queries for mobile optimization
- Implementing collapsible sections for better mobile experience
- Using accordion-style UI pattern for plan sections to save vertical space

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular code organization (separate files for different concerns)
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Component-based JavaScript structure
- Database migrations for schema evolution using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
- Structured AI output with defined schemas
- Enhanced user authentication flow with context-aware responses
- Environment-specific cookie security settings (secure=True and samesite="lax" in production)
- Using Poetry for Python dependency management and virtual environments
- Visual design patterns with cards, timelines, and color-coded sections
- Intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI text
- Content-specific icons for bullet points based on keyword analysis
- Bullet list format for structured content like daily plans and next steps
- Modal confirmation dialogs for important user actions
- Automatic session validation and smart redirects
- Consistent UI patterns between form and results pages
- Responsive design with breakpoints at 768px (tablet) and 480px (mobile)
- Collapsible sections with accordion behavior for better space utilization
- Visual indicators (arrows) for interactive elements
- Smooth transitions for UI state changes

## Learnings and Insights
- The application is an AI-powered life purpose guidance system
- The two-tier payment model allows users to get basic insights before committing to the full experience
- Astrological signs provide personalization without being explicitly mentioned to users
- Stoic philosophy underpins the guidance provided
- Database schema evolution requires careful migration planning
- User authentication flow needs to be context-aware to provide a seamless experience
- Modern browsers have increasingly strict cookie policies in HTTPS environments, requiring proper security attributes
- Production environments require secure=True and appropriate samesite attributes for cookies to work properly
- Checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach improves user experience
- The project uses PostgreSQL for the database, not SQLite
- Database migrations should be written using SQLAlchemy and the project's existing migration patterns
- Always use Poetry to run Python scripts in this project (e.g., `poetry run python script.py`)
- Payment systems need to be flexible to allow for scenarios like result regeneration
- AI-generated content needs intelligent parsing to create structured, user-friendly displays
- Visual organization of information significantly improves user experience and comprehension
- Content-specific icons provide immediate visual cues that help users quickly understand the nature of each item
- Bullet list format makes structured content more scannable and digestible for users
- Keyword analysis can be used to intelligently assign relevant icons to content items
- Automatic session checking improves user experience by reducing unnecessary login steps
- Confirmation modals for paid actions help users make informed decisions
- Consistent UI patterns between different parts of the application improve user experience
- Loading spinners should only be shown when actually loading content, not during confirmation steps
- Mobile responsiveness is critical for modern web applications, requiring specific optimizations
- Collapsible sections significantly improve mobile experience by reducing scrolling and focusing attention
- Accordion-style UI patterns are effective for presenting multiple content sections in limited space
- Visual indicators (like arrows) help users understand interactive elements
- Smooth transitions improve perceived performance and provide a more polished user experience

# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing and refining the database schema, AI integration, and user authentication flow for the life purpose application. The focus is on supporting the two-tier payment model, improving result generation, enhancing the user experience, and streamlining the authentication process.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed the "Update My Plan" button functionality for users with premium plans:
  - Made the form page use the exact same modal as the results page
  - Removed the large Cancel button, leaving just an "X" in the corner
  - Fixed issues with the loading spinner appearing prematurely and remaining on screen
  - Ensured consistent user experience between form and results pages
  - Made the regeneration modal properly display the correct price based on user's tier
- Improved modal handling across the application:
  - Standardized modal design and behavior
  - Enhanced close button functionality to properly hide all related modals
  - Improved loading state management to only show spinners when appropriate

## Next Steps
- Refine the user experience for the payment flow
- Implement additional error handling and edge cases
- Optimize AI prompt templates for better insights
- Consider adding export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Explore adding progress tracking for completed plan items

## Active Decisions
- Using structured JSON data for storing AI-generated results
- Implementing a two-tier payment model (basic: $0.99, premium: $4.99)
- Using database migrations for schema evolution
- Incorporating astrological signs and Stoic philosophy in AI guidance
- Using Pydantic models for structured AI output
- Sending magic links to users with existing data to ensure secure access
- Using intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI-generated text
- Implementing visually distinct sections for different parts of the life plan
- Using content-specific icons for bullet points to improve visual comprehension
- Structuring daily plan and next steps as bullet lists for better readability
- Providing plan regeneration option for premium users
- Implementing automatic session checking for seamless user experience
- Using consistent modal design patterns across the application

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular code organization (separate files for different concerns)
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Component-based JavaScript structure
- Database migrations for schema evolution using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
- Structured AI output with defined schemas
- Enhanced user authentication flow with context-aware responses
- Using Poetry for Python dependency management and virtual environments
- Visual design patterns with cards, timelines, and color-coded sections
- Intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI text
- Content-specific icons for bullet points based on keyword analysis
- Bullet list format for structured content like daily plans and next steps
- Modal confirmation dialogs for important user actions
- Automatic session validation and smart redirects
- Consistent UI patterns between form and results pages

## Learnings and Insights
- The application is an AI-powered life purpose guidance system
- The two-tier payment model allows users to get basic insights before committing to the full experience
- Astrological signs provide personalization without being explicitly mentioned to users
- Stoic philosophy underpins the guidance provided
- Database schema evolution requires careful migration planning
- User authentication flow needs to be context-aware to provide a seamless experience
- Checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach improves user experience
- The project uses PostgreSQL for the database, not SQLite
- Database migrations should be written using SQLAlchemy and the project's existing migration patterns
- Always use Poetry to run Python scripts in this project (e.g., `poetry run python script.py`)
- Payment systems need to be flexible to allow for scenarios like result regeneration
- AI-generated content needs intelligent parsing to create structured, user-friendly displays
- Visual organization of information significantly improves user experience and comprehension
- Content-specific icons provide immediate visual cues that help users quickly understand the nature of each item
- Bullet list format makes structured content more scannable and digestible for users
- Keyword analysis can be used to intelligently assign relevant icons to content items
- Automatic session checking improves user experience by reducing unnecessary login steps
- Confirmation modals for paid actions help users make informed decisions
- Consistent UI patterns between different parts of the application improve user experience
- Loading spinners should only be shown when actually loading content, not during confirmation steps

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

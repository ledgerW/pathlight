# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing and refining the database schema, AI integration, and user authentication flow for the life purpose application. The focus is on supporting the two-tier payment model, improving result generation, enhancing the user experience, and streamlining the authentication process.

## Recent Changes
- Modified the Results table schema to replace "summary" with a structured "basic_plan" JSON field
- Added "last_generated_at" column to the Results table to track when results were last generated
- Added "regeneration_count" column to the Results table to track how many times results have been regenerated
- Implemented database migration scripts for these schema changes
- Enhanced AI integration with structured output using Pydantic models
- Implemented two-tier result generation (basic after 5 questions, premium after all 25)
- Improved user authentication flow to properly handle existing users with saved responses
- Enhanced the find_user_by_email endpoint to check for existing responses and results
- Updated client-side code to send magic links to users with existing data
- Improved form navigation at question 5 to allow users with basic results to continue to question 6
- Added clear button labeling with "Get Purpose"/"Update Purpose" at question 5 and "Get Plan"/"Update Plan" at question 25
- Implemented result regeneration functionality with payment support
- Modified payment system to allow users to pay again for regenerating results
- Enhanced results display with structured, visually appealing sections for the Plan tab
- Improved handling of basic vs premium results to prioritize premium content when available
- Added intelligent content parsing to extract and organize AI-generated content into meaningful sections
- Implemented visual timeline for Next Steps, card-based layout for Daily Plan, and paired cards for Obstacles & Solutions
- Restructured daily plan items as bullet points with content-specific icons for better readability
- Restructured next steps as Today, Next 7, 30, 180 days with bullet points and descriptive icons
- Fixed issue with Today actions displaying twice in the timeline
- Implemented a smart icon selection system that analyzes content and assigns appropriate icons from a set of 20 topic-specific icons
- Added "Update Plan" button functionality for premium users to regenerate their plan
- Created a confirmation modal for plan regeneration with clear pricing information
- Updated payment verification to track regeneration count and last generated timestamp
- Implemented automatic session checking on site arrival to redirect authenticated users
- Enhanced home page and login routes to check for valid sessions and redirect appropriately

## Next Steps
- Test the updated form navigation to ensure it works correctly in all scenarios
- Test the result regeneration functionality in all scenarios
- Test the enhanced results display with various AI-generated content formats
- Test the new content-specific icon system with various types of plan items
- Test the automatic session checking and redirection flow
- Refine the user experience for the payment flow
- Implement additional error handling and edge cases
- Optimize AI prompt templates for better insights
- Consider adding export functionality for the plan (PDF, email, etc.)
- Explore adding progress tracking for completed plan items

## Active Decisions
- Using structured JSON data for storing AI-generated results
- Implementing a two-tier payment model (basic: $0.99, premium: $4.99)
- Using database migrations for schema evolution
- Incorporating astrological signs and Stoic philosophy in AI guidance
- Using Pydantic models for structured AI output
- Sending magic links to users with existing data to ensure secure access
- Using intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI-generated text
- Implementing visually distinct sections for different parts of the life plan
- Using content-specific icons for bullet points to improve visual comprehension
- Structuring daily plan and next steps as bullet lists for better readability
- Providing plan regeneration option for premium users
- Implementing automatic session checking for seamless user experience

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Modular code organization (separate files for different concerns)
- Clear separation between frontend and backend
- Component-based JavaScript structure
- Database migrations for schema evolution using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL
- Structured AI output with defined schemas
- Enhanced user authentication flow with context-aware responses
- Using Poetry for Python dependency management and virtual environments
- Visual design patterns with cards, timelines, and color-coded sections
- Intelligent content parsing to extract structured information from AI text
- Content-specific icons for bullet points based on keyword analysis
- Bullet list format for structured content like daily plans and next steps
- Modal confirmation dialogs for important user actions
- Automatic session validation and smart redirects

## Learnings and Insights
- The application is an AI-powered life purpose guidance system
- The two-tier payment model allows users to get basic insights before committing to the full experience
- Astrological signs provide personalization without being explicitly mentioned to users
- Stoic philosophy underpins the guidance provided
- Database schema evolution requires careful migration planning
- User authentication flow needs to be context-aware to provide a seamless experience
- Checking for existing user data before deciding on authentication approach improves user experience
- The project uses PostgreSQL for the database, not SQLite
- Database migrations should be written using SQLAlchemy and the project's existing migration patterns
- Always use Poetry to run Python scripts in this project (e.g., `poetry run python script.py`)
- Payment systems need to be flexible to allow for scenarios like result regeneration
- AI-generated content needs intelligent parsing to create structured, user-friendly displays
- Visual organization of information significantly improves user experience and comprehension
- Content-specific icons provide immediate visual cues that help users quickly understand the nature of each item
- Bullet list format makes structured content more scannable and digestible for users
- Keyword analysis can be used to intelligently assign relevant icons to content items
- Automatic session checking improves user experience by reducing unnecessary login steps
- Confirmation modals for paid actions help users make informed decisions

This document will be continuously updated as work progresses and new insights are gained.

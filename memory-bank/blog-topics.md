# Pathlight Blog Topics

This document outlines blog topics for Pathlight's content marketing and SEO strategy. Unlike guides which focus on practical application of the Pathlight tool, blog posts are oriented around general education and exploration of topics like philosophy, psychology, and research in the domain of purpose discovery.

## Introduction

The Pathlight blog serves as a platform for deeper exploration of the concepts, research, and philosophical foundations that underpin our purpose discovery methodology. While our guides help users maximize their experience with the Pathlight application, our blog content aims to educate, inspire, and engage readers with broader discussions about purpose, meaning, personal growth, and the human experience.

Each blog post should be approximately 1200-1500 words long, written in an accessible yet thoughtful style that invites readers to reflect on their own lives and purpose journeys. Posts should incorporate relevant research, philosophical concepts, and practical insights while maintaining an engaging, conversational tone.

## üåü Overview

Pathlight is a web application that helps users discover their life purpose through a series of 25 carefully crafted reflective questions. Using advanced AI capabilities, the application generates personalized insights and practical guidance tailored to each user's unique responses.

The application follows a three-tier payment model:
- **Purpose Tier** ($0.99): Basic insights after answering the first 5 questions
- **Plan Tier** ($4.99): Comprehensive guidance after answering all 25 questions
- **Pursuit Tier** ($4.99/month): Subscription with unlimited plan regenerations and premium features

- OpenAI API credentials

### üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathlight.git
cd pathlight
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/pathlight
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STYTCH_PROJECT_ID=your_stytch_project_id
STYTCH_SECRET=your_stytch_secret
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
poetry run python migrations/run_all_migrations.py
```

5. Start the application:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

## üìñ Usage

### User Journey

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User visits landing page] --> B[User creates account]
    B --> C[User answers first 5 questions]
    C --> D[User pays $0.99 for Purpose tier]
    D --> E[User receives basic results]
    E --> F[User answers remaining 20 questions]
    F --> G{Payment tier?}
    G -->|Plan tier| H[User pays $4.99 one-time]
    G -->|Pursuit tier| I[User subscribes for $4.99/month]
    H --> J[User receives full plan]
    I --> K[User receives full plan with regeneration]
    K --> L[User can update responses and regenerate plan]
```

### Key Interfaces

The application consists of several key interfaces:

1. **Landing Page**: Introduction to Pathlight
2. **Form Interface**: 25 questions with progress tracking
3. **Payment Interface**: Tier selection and payment processing
4. **Results Interface**: Visualization of personalized insights
5. **Account Management**: User profile and subscription management

## üß™ Testing

The application includes a comprehensive testing suite covering unit tests for all components.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test categories
poetry run pytest tests/unit/models/
poetry run pytest tests/unit/routers/auth/
poetry run pytest tests/unit/routers/payments/
poetry run pytest tests/unit/routers/ai/
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Testing Approach Details</summary>

### Testing Strategy

The tests use a comprehensive mocking strategy to isolate the application from external dependencies:

1. **Database**: Uses an in-memory SQLite database for testing
2. **Stripe API**: Mocks all Stripe API calls for payment processing
3. **Stytch API**: Mocks authentication and session management
4. **LangChain/OpenAI**: Mocks AI model calls with predefined responses

### Test Categories

- **Model Tests**: CRUD operations for User, FormResponse, and Result models
- **Auth Tests**: Login, session management, and token handling
- **Payment Tests**: Checkout, verification, webhooks, and subscription management
- **AI Tests**: Purpose and plan generation using LangChain/OpenAI

Finding your life’s purpose is a personal journey that takes reflection and courage. Psychologist Carl Jung described individuation as “the process of self-realisation, the discovery and experience of meaning and purpose in life” . The questions below draw on multiple frameworks – from the Japanese concept of Ikigai to Viktor Frankl’s logotherapy, Jungian psychology, Stanford’s Life Design methods, and positive psychology research – all to help you explore different facets of yourself. They are organized in stages (Self-Discovery, Skills & Strengths, Core Values, Visioning, Alignment, etc.) to guide you step-by-step. Take your time journaling on each section, and be honest with yourself. This is your own introspective journey, so there are no “right” answers – only answers that ring true for you.



Self-Discovery: Uncovering Who You Are


Start by exploring your inner world – your passions, personality, memories, and even the “shadow” parts of yourself that you might not usually consider. The goal here is to gain a clearer picture of who you truly are, beyond societal roles. (After all, knowing yourself is the foundation for finding meaning.) Reflect on the following:

Joy and Flow: What activities make you feel most alive and engaged? When do you find yourself so absorbed that you lose track of time? Describe moments when you’ve experienced this state of flow and what you were doing.

Early Passions: What did you love doing as a child? What were your favorite games or hobbies, and what did you dream of becoming when you were younger? How do those early passions make you feel now, and do any of them still call to you?

Current Interests: What are your favorite hobbies or interests today, and why do you enjoy them? What do these interests reveal about what brings you happiness or fulfillment?

Proud Moments: Recall a few accomplishments or moments in life you’re truly proud of – big or small. What do those moments say about you? (For example, achieving a personal goal might show determination; helping someone might show compassion.)

Identity & Personality: How would you describe yourself in a few words? Think of core traits (creative, adventurous, empathetic, analytical, etc.) that feel central to who you are. Which of these traits are you most proud of?

Archetypes & Roles: Are there certain roles or archetypes you naturally identify with? For instance, do you often see yourself as a caretaker, a creator/artist, an explorer, a leader, a rebel, or perhaps a teacher? What draws you to these roles, and how do they manifest in your life?

Your Authentic Self: In what situations do you feel most authentically yourself? Conversely, are there times you feel you have to put on a “mask” or play a role that doesn’t quite fit your true self? Describe how it feels, and what parts of yourself you wish you could express more openly.

Hidden Qualities: Are there aspects of you – interests, talents, or traits – that you’ve been hesitant to acknowledge or show others (maybe out of fear or doubt)? List a few. What positive potential might lie in these “hidden” parts of you if you embraced them more fully?

Life Experiences: Identify a few life experiences (positive or negative) that have deeply shaped who you are. Why were these moments so impactful? What did each experience teach you about yourself or what you value?



(Reflection Tip: As you journal, notice any themes in what you love, fear, or yearn for. This self-discovery forms the basis of your purpose, much like gathering pieces of a puzzle.)



Skills & Strengths: Recognizing Your Gifts


This section focuses on what you’re good at – your natural talents, skills, and strengths. Knowing your gifts can boost your confidence and point toward ways to put them to use. Positive psychology suggests that using our strengths regularly can lead to greater engagement and meaning in life . Reflect on the following questions:

Natural Talents: What abilities come so naturally to you that you almost take them for granted – things that might not come as easily to others ? (These could be anything from being a great listener, to excelling at math, cooking, problem-solving, or making people laugh.)

Strengths List: Make a list of your personal strengths or skills that you’re aware of. Which three to five strengths do you value the most in yourself, and why?

Outside Feedback: What do friends, family, or colleagues often compliment you on or ask for your help with? Sometimes others notice our strengths more than we do. What do their observations tell you about your talents?

Peak Performance: Think of a time when you felt especially competent and effective at something – maybe at work, in school, or during a personal project. What were you doing, and which skills were you using? How did it feel to excel in that moment?

Quick Learner: What subjects or activities have you learned very quickly or easily in the past? (These might indicate areas of natural aptitude.) How did you feel while learning or performing those?

Enjoyable Skills: Among the skills you have, which ones do you most enjoy using? There might be things you’re good at but don’t particularly enjoy – and things you love doing even if you’re not “the best” at them. What’s the difference between the two for you?

Skill Development: Are there any skills or abilities you want to develop further, even if you’re not adept at them yet? What draws you to these, and how might developing them open new possibilities in your life?

“Energy” Activities: Reflect on tasks that energize you versus those that drain you. Which of your strengths are engaged in the energizing activities, and which activities (even ones you do well) leave you cold? This can be a clue to aligning your work with your passions.



(Reflection Tip: Look for overlap between what you enjoy and what you’re good at. Those areas – your potential vocations – are gold when it comes to life purpose. If you notice some skills you’re good at but don’t enjoy, that’s important too; your purpose will likely lie elsewhere, closer to the things that light you up.)



Core Values & Meaning: Clarifying What Matters


Next, examine your core values, beliefs, and the sources of meaning in your life. Viktor Frankl – a psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust – observed that people can find profound meaning through purposeful work, through love and relationships, and through the attitude they take toward suffering . With that in mind, think about what truly matters to you and what “meaning” looks like in your life:

Top Values: What are your top 3–5 core values or guiding principles in life? (Examples: honesty, freedom, family, creativity, compassion, adventure, security, etc.) Write them down and explain why each is so important to you. How do these values show up in your daily decisions?

Life Philosophy: How do you define a “good life” for yourself? What does success mean to you personally? Consider writing a few sentences about what success or fulfillment really means in your view (for example, “Success to me means raising happy, kind children” or “living in alignment with my principles,” etc.).

Meaningful Moments: Recall a time when you felt a deep sense of meaning or purpose. What were you doing, and why did it feel so meaningful? What does that experience tell you about what matters most to you?

Love and Relationships: Who are the people (family, friends, mentors) or what relationships in your life give you a sense of purpose or motivation? How do you contribute to their lives, and how do they contribute to yours?

Impact & Causes: What causes, issues, or problems in society stir a strong emotion in you – whether it’s anger, passion, or heartbreak? Maybe it’s climate change, social justice, helping the vulnerable, spreading beauty or knowledge, etc. List a few issues you deeply care about. Why do these matter to you, and in what ways do you wish things were different?

Guiding Passions: Apart from moral values, what passions or interests do you consider most meaningful? (For example, art, technology, nature, teaching, spirituality.) Why do these matter so much to you personally?

Learning from Challenges: Think of one of the biggest challenges or painful experiences you’ve faced in life. What did you learn from it? How did it change you or your perspective on what’s important? Did any positive values or purpose grow from that struggle?

Integrity Check: Are there any principles or beliefs you hold so strongly that you’d stand up for them even if it was hard? What are they, and why are they non-negotiable for you?

Legacy: Imagine you’re many years in the future, looking back at your life. What do you hope you will have contributed or accomplished? What kind of legacy or impact do you want to leave behind?

“Life’s Question”: Instead of asking what you want from life, ask: What do you feel life is asking of you? In other words, what responsibility or calling do you feel the world (or your circumstances) is presenting to you right now? This question can shift your perspective from personal desire to a sense of duty or mission. Write down whatever comes to mind – it could be as grand as “to help others heal” or as personal as “to be a loving parent” – there’s no wrong answer if it resonates deeply.



(Optional Reflection: If you find it hard to identify your core values, try this exercise: Imagine you learn you have only one year left to live – what would become most important for you to do or focus on in that time? What would you regret not doing? Often, this thought experiment shines a light on what we value most.)



Visioning: Envisioning Your Future Possibilities


Having reflected on your present self, now project into the future. This stage is about visioning – imagining what a fulfilling, purpose-driven life could look like. Here, you can be creative and think big. Stanford’s Life Design approach, for example, suggests that there are many possible “yous” and encourages designing multiple futures (Odyssey Plans) . By envisioning different scenarios, you might spot common themes and new ideas for your life. Explore the following:

Ideal Future: Imagine it’s 5 or 10 years from now and you are living a deeply fulfilling life. What does a perfect day in that life look like? Describe it from morning to night: Where are you? Who are you with? What activities fill your day? How do you feel throughout the day? (This “best possible self” visualization can reveal what elements are essential for your happiness.)

Unrealized Dreams: What goals, dreams or aspirations have you thought about but not pursued yet? List a few “bucket list” items or paths (personal, career, creative, etc.) that you still want to explore. What intrigues or excites you about each of these possibilities?

Removing Limits: If all obstacles were removed – if you had all the money, time, support, and skills you needed – what would you do with your life that you’re not doing now? What passion or path might you jump into if fear or practical constraints weren’t an issue?

Reigniting Passions: Is there any passion or interest you’ve put on the backburner (perhaps to focus on career or others’ expectations)? What is it, and what feelings do you have when you think about that unrealized interest? Imagine giving yourself permission to pursue it – what might that look like?

Role Models: Think of 1 or 2 people you greatly admire and who inspire you. What is it about their life or character that you find inspiring? (For example: their generosity, their adventurous life, their contributions to science/art, their balance of career and family.) How would you incorporate those qualities or actions into your own envisioned future?

Life Balance: Picture your future in a holistic way. In a purposeful life, how would you ideally balance the different areas – such as career, family, health, social life, leisure, and personal growth? Are there areas you realize you want to give more attention to than you currently do?

Reflection Exercise – Odyssey Plans: Brainstorm three different versions of your next 5–10 years (an “Odyssey Plan” exercise from life design) :

Plan #1: What would your life look like if you continued on your current path? (Imagine you keep doing what you’re doing now – how might things evolve in five years?)

Plan #2: What would your life look like if for some reason your current path or option was no longer available? (If you had to make a change, what alternative path might you pursue?)

Plan #3: What would your life look like if you could do anything you wanted, regardless of money or others’ opinions? (Your “wildest dream” life – the path you might pursue if you felt completely free and supported.)

For each scenario, jot down what excites you about it, what challenges it might have, and which of your values or interests it honors. The goal isn’t to choose one right now, but to see that there are multiple ways you could live a fulfilling life – and notice what common threads run through your different dreams.



(Reflection Tip: As you imagine these futures, pay attention to how you feel. Excitement or a sense of “this feels right” might indicate something to incorporate into your real life. Also note if there’s any part of your vision that scares you because it matters – fear can sometimes signal a true passion.)



Alignment with the World: Connecting Self with Society


The Japanese concept of Ikigai illustrates that a truly purposeful life exists at the intersection of four things: what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for . In this stage, reflect on how to connect your personal insights with the outside world. This is about finding alignment between who you are (your passions, skills, and values) and how you can contribute to others or meet real needs – in a sustainable way. In other words, how can you translate self-knowledge into a role or path that not only fulfills you internally but also resonates with and is valued by the wider world?

Needs of the World: Consider the problems, needs, or gaps you see around you – in your community or globally – that deeply concern or inspire you. What issues do you feel drawn to help solve or address? “Are there problems or challenges in your community or in the world you feel passionate about solving? Identify them. There’s your mission.” Write down any causes or needs that you feel a connection to (no matter how big or small).

Intersection of “You” and “Need”: Looking at the needs or causes you listed, where do they overlap with your own passions and skills? For example, if you love teaching and you’re good at graphic design, and you care about education, perhaps designing educational materials or teaching art to kids could be an intersection. Brainstorm a few ideas or fields where what you enjoy and do well could meet something the world needs.

Getting Paid: Now think practically: what kinds of jobs, careers, or roles might allow you to work at that intersection you identified? List any specific careers or opportunities that combine your interests/skills with a market or community need (no matter how unconventional). Are there ways you could earn a living (or even a side income) doing these things?

Passion to Profession: How might you start turning your passion and mission into a profession or vocation? For example, if you’re a talented pianist who believes the world needs more music, you might start teaching others to play . If you care about climate and love engineering, maybe a renewable energy project or company is a path. Think of one practical avenue to monetize or sustain the work you feel called to – even if it’s part-time or volunteer at first.

Small Experiments: What small step or experiment could you try to test out one of these interests in the real world? (For instance, volunteering for a cause you care about, doing a one-day shadowing of someone in a field, starting a blog or small project, taking a workshop, or freelancing on a tiny gig.) Describe one or two low-risk actions you could take in the next few weeks or months to dip your toe in the water.

Using Strengths for Good: How can you use your personal strengths in service of something greater than yourself? Research suggests that using your talents to benefit others is a key to a meaningful life . For each of your top strengths, think of a way it could help someone else or contribute to a cause. (E.g., if one strength is “communication,” could it be used to advocate for an issue or mentor others?)

Support Network: Who could help or support you as you move toward your purpose? List people or groups you might turn to – mentors, friends with similar interests, professional networks, community organizations, etc. Sometimes a conversation with someone in the field or having an accountability buddy can propel you forward.

Anticipating Obstacles: What challenges or fears do you anticipate in pursuing this path (for example, financial barriers, lack of time, self-doubt, family expectations)? Write these down. For each, brainstorm one possible way to address it. (Sometimes just acknowledging obstacles and having a plan can reduce their power.)

Work-Life Alignment: How well is your current life aligned with the insights you’ve gained so far? Are there things in your current job, studies, or routine that already contribute to your sense of purpose? And what things are out of alignment? Identify one change you could make (even a small tweak in your routine or approach) to bring your life more in line with what matters to you.

Contribution & Legacy: In the end, what do you hope your work and life contribute to others? This might tie back to the legacy question. Try to summarize the impact you want to have – it could be “spread kindness daily,” “help improve one person’s life at a time,” “create beautiful art that inspires,” or “solve technical problems that make life easier.” There’s no wrong answer. This is the essence of how you want to serve the world around you.



(Reflection Tip: Aligning your life with your purpose is often a gradual process. It’s okay to start small. Even if you can’t switch careers or dedicate all your time to your passion right now, find little ways to bring more of you into what you do. Purpose can be lived in moments as well as in grand plans.)



Integration & Next Steps: Bringing It All Together


In this final stage, step back and look at everything you’ve discovered. It’s time to integrate these insights and consider practical next steps. Remember that discovering purpose is not a one-time epiphany but an ongoing journey of growth and refinement . These questions will help you summarize your thoughts and start moving forward:

Common Themes: Review your journaling from all the sections above. What patterns or common themes do you see emerging? Do certain values, activities, or passions keep coming up? (For example, you might notice a theme of “teaching/mentoring” or “creating art” or values like “freedom” throughout your answers.) List a few recurring themes that feel significant.

Purpose Statement: Based on those themes, try to write a one-sentence purpose statement for yourself. Don’t worry about making it perfect. For instance: “My purpose is to use my [skills/strengths] to [action/service] so that [desired impact].” or “I am here to ….”. Write a sentence (or a short paragraph) that resonates with you and captures the essence of what you want your life to be about.

Immediate Step: What’s one small step you can take this week or month to start living out your purpose in a tiny way? It could be scheduling a coffee chat with someone in a field you’re interested in, signing up for a class, dedicating an hour to a project you care about, or practicing a habit that aligns with your values. Choose something concrete and achievable to build momentum.

Accountability: How will you keep yourself motivated and on track in pursuing this journey? Consider making a simple plan: Will you set aside time each week to work on your goals? Check in with a friend or mentor about progress? Keep a journal to reflect on your path? Write down a few strategies to stay accountable to yourself.

Adapting Over Time: Life purposes can evolve. How will you continue to explore and refine your sense of purpose as you grow? (For example, committing to periodic self-reflection, being open to new experiences, or revisiting these questions in a year.) Remind yourself that it’s okay for your vision to change as you gain new insights.



Remember: This is a journey, not a destination. Your purpose may become clearer over time as you gain new experiences and wisdom. Keep listening to yourself and stay open to growth. As the concept of Ikigai teaches, aligning what you love, what you’re good at, and what the world needs is a continuous process of self-discovery and growth . Be patient and kind to yourself along the way. Each small step you take in the direction of your authentic interests and values is significant. Happy exploring, Zara, and may this journey bring you clarity and inspiration as you discover what gives you a true sense of purpose."""
